# Rykers-Shaders
I made some pretty badly optimised shaders, wanna see?

This is a personal project that I made just to play around with shaders. I know some of these have already been made but I still really like trying to do these things myself.

This project was made with Unity version 2021.3.22f1 
These are meant to be standalone shaders that have no dependencies except for unity. 

Thank you for checking it out!
